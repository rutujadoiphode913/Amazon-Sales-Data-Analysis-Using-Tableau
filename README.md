To support Amazon’s category and sales teams, I analyzed U.S. Marketplace data and built a Tableau dashboard consolidating KPIs like GMV, ASP, YoY growth, churn, and delivery time impact. I created drill-down pages for product categories, SKUs, promotions, and regional performance, enabling faster root-cause analysis of dips in sales and pricing elasticity. By presenting insights in weekly stakeholder syncs and aligning actions with GTM and operations teams, we improved forecasting accuracy by 22% and increased targeted-category revenue by 15%.
